	I have taken an HTML class before, but that was before HTML5 had been revealed.  How awesome that we have a new way to structure pages that
	doesn't involve div after div after div, which got confusing and cluttered very quickly.  This is by far my biggest take-away and something I
	would like to experiment with more. 
	<br/>
	
	<br/>
		An additional new concept to me is extending HTML with server-side and client-side scripting.  I am familiar with basic scripting and API's, 
	this seems like a big topic and we just got an intro so I am looking forward to delving into this more in future classes.  
	<br/>

	SEO is also an interesting topic, I understood the basics about how different browsers gather and compile information.  I found that my personal
	web browsing seemed to become more difficult at some point and I realize now it was due to SEO that I was unable to find things I used to be able 
	to locate on the internet.  Good to know not only for marketing and business purposes, but also for personal internet searching.
